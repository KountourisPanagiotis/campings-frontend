A [Coding Factory](https://codingfactory.aueb.gr/) @ [AUEB](https://aueb.gr/) Final Web Project. Angular - Typescript - Campings frontend site. ‚õ∫‚õ∫‚õ∫

## Description
The Camping Frontend is a web application developed using Angular framework on the front-end and Java on the back-end. The back-end is provided on the [campings-backend](https://github.com/KountourisPanagiotis/campings-backend/blob/main/README.md) repository. The front-end provides a user-friendly interface for managing campgrounds, bookings, customers, staff, payments, and categories. The system allows users to perform various operations such as creating, updating, and deleting records, as well as viewing live statistics and reports.

## Features

- Payment Management: Record and track payments.
- Category Management: Manage different categories for campgrounds.
- Statistics: Generate statistics and reports for bookings and payments.

## Technologies Used

- Front-end: Angular
- Back-end: Java
- Database: MySQL
- UI Framework: Angular Material

## Additional Notes
- Angular Material Modules: The project utilizes various modules from Angular Material for UI components and styling.
- HttpClientModule: The HttpClientModule is used for making HTTP requests to communicate with the back-end services.
- RouterModule and Routes: The application utilizes the RouterModule to define and configure the application routes. The routes array in the app.module.ts file specifies the different paths and their corresponding components.
- MatSnackBarModule: The MatSnackBarModule from Angular Material is used for displaying pop-up messages (snack bars) in the application.
